02456 Deep Learning Project 7a : Bayesian Neural Network Classification

Credits : 
Large parts of the code used in this repository for created the Bayesian neural network sturcture are taken from https://github.com/Harry24k/bayesian-neural-network-pytorch. 

Workframe : 
We use .py files to define classes and functions.
All visualisation and other code is run in the Jupyter Notebook interface.
